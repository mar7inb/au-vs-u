Scanning Windows: Authenticated vs Unauthenticated

In this Project we will go over scanning Windows in the Authenticated form and Unauthenticated. 

Key Benefits of performing these scans:
Authenticated scans use login credentials to check inside a system for vulnerabilities like weak passwords, missing updates, or misconfigurations, giving a detailed view of internal risks. Unauthenticated scans look at the system from the outside, identifying weaknesses visible to attackers, like open ports or outdated software.

In simple terms:
Authenticated scans show what a trusted user (or an attacker with access) can see and exploit.
Unauthenticated scans show what an outsider can see and try to attack.
Using both ensures you secure both the inside and outside of your systems.
